        <p>Hello ! My name is Grace Hao and I'm a second year computer engineering student at the University of Toronto. 
        <br><br>
        As a second year student, I'm in the midst of exploring the field of computer engineering to determine my area of interest. However, I am particularly interested in the software aspect of computer engineering and the application of software programming in biomedical sciences to aid in the design of computer systems and programs used in healthcare. Being a student, I am always open to exploring and taking on a variety of opportunities that will enable me to showcase or develop my skills. 
        <br><br>
        When I'm not studying, you can find me making modifications to this website, drawing, playing games, or listening to wellness podcasts.

        <div class="gallery-title">My Journey Through <span class="highlighted-word">Art</span></div>
        <div class="gallery-text">
            <p> From the age of six, I started attending weekly drawing classes outside of school. In the beginning, art classes were an obligatory extracurricular that I devoted an hour of my week to, which I thought could be used for doing anything else. 
                However, over the years, I started to appreciate the beauty of art as a medium of expression and a form of stress-relief. During the most stressful times of my life, I continued to consistently attend art classes on a weekly basis as it enabled me to slow down and direct my attention towards creating a piece of art. 
                <br><br>
                I explored a variety of art mediums; from colored pencils to water color to acrylic, I tried them all. Through this, I found that I particularly enjoyed drawing still-life, which involves depicting inanimate objects like fruits, vases, or fabrics. I also have various pieces that are drawn from sculptures. These art forms are drawn through the use of sketching pencils and uses various sketching techniques like hatching, stippling, and blending to create a cohesive piece of art. 
                <br></br>
                Through practicing art for over a decade, I've developed a variety of soft and technical skills that I otherwise wouldn't have been able to learn from the classroom alone.
